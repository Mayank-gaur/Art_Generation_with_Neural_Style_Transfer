# Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.

We will build the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm in three steps:

Build the content cost function  𝐽𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝐶,𝐺) 
Build the style cost function  𝐽𝑠𝑡𝑦𝑙𝑒(𝑆,𝐺) 
Put it together to get  𝐽(𝐺)=𝛼𝐽𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝐶,𝐺)+𝛽𝐽𝑠𝑡𝑦𝑙𝑒(𝑆,𝐺) .
